## Description

BirthdayBuddy is an application that allows users/clients to create a list that allows them to save gifts that they'll get for all of their favorite or important people in there life. This app was made in mind for users who tend to be a little forgetful or for users who have a lot of people around them. It helps users remember what gifts to get their close friends and family and allows them to not have any repeat gifts. It also ensures them make sure that they don't get the same gift for two different people since they are able to always check what gift they have lined up next for each person.
