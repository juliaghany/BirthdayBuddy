## Description

GiftGuide is an application that allows users to keep track of gift ideas for their friends and family. With GiftGuide, the user will be able to create a list for each person they'd like to purchase gifts for, assign an occasion to each gift idea, and modify their list depending on whether they either no longer want to purchase that gift or have already purchased it.
